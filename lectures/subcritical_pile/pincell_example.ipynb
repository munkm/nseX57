The object that allows us to assign a material to a region of space is called a `Cell` (same concept in MCNP, for those familiar). In order to define a region that we can assign to a cell, we must first define surfaces which bound the region. A *surface* is a locus of zeros of a function of Cartesian coordinates $x$, $y$, and $z$, e.g.\n",

A surface *half-space* is the region whose points satisfy a positive or negative inequality of the surface equation. For example, for a sphere of radius one centered at the origin, the surface equation is $f(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 1 = 0$. Thus, we say that the negative half-space of the sphere, is defined as the collection of points satisfying $f(x,y,z) < 0$, which one can reason is the inside of the sphere. Conversely, the positive half-space of the sphere would correspond to all points outside of the sphere.\n",
